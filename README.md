# CodeClauseInternship_Customer-Segmentation
The manager of the XYZ mall has tried gathering some details regarding the customers who visit the mall.

The dataset columns like customer ID, gender of the customer, age of the customer, the annual income of the customer given to us in thousand dollars and the spending score which ranges from 1 to 100.

A good spending score which is close to 100 indicates a good customer and spending score close to 1 indicates a bad customer.

The manager has come up to us with this data saying that he has an offer in his mind which he wants to roll out to specific customers by personally calling them.

Problem Statement: Find out the optimum number of segments that can be generated, segment the customers and help the manager with the potential customers.

This is an Unsupervised Machine learning problem, that requires customer segmentation. 
The algorithm used is K nearest neighour.
The value of the K is found out with the help of Elbow Curve method, that came to be 5.
Once the optimum value is found the data is segmented into these 5 segments. 
The data is graphically represented with the help of lmplot. 
Hence the customer segmentationnwas done successfully.
